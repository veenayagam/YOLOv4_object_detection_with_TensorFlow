# YOLOv4_object_detection_with_TensorFlow

I have created object detection model with Yolov4 and TensorFlow. COCO dataset has been used to train this model.

This model is able to identify various types of vehicles. The hyperparameter used for this model will be IOU 0.45 and confidence of 0.25. This model helps improve traffic control by regulating traffic signals in order to minimize traffic congestion and improve road safety.
